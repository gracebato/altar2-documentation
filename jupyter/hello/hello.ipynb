    "An AlTar application is based on the [pyre](https://github.com/pyre/pyre) framework. Compared with traditional Python programming, the `pyre` framework provides enhanced features for developing high performance scientific applications, including\n",
    "\n",
    "- It introduces configurable components. Users may want to choose between different algorithms/methods for a given procedure, which in general requires developing new applications and/or recompiling the source code. With configurable components, users can now specify their choices at runtime with the same application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- It offers users an easy way to configure parameters/settings in an application. To pass parameters through command line (e.g, by `argparse`) and property `setter` is usually a formidable task for applications with a large parameter set. In pyre, this can be done by one `json`-type configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An AlTar/pyre application can deploy itself automatically to different computing platforms, such as a standalone computer, GPU workstations, computer clusters or clouds, with a simple change of the `shell` configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyre also integrates supports to [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (for linear algebra and statistics), and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (for GPU accelerated computing), to achieve high performance while maintaining the user-friendly interface offered by Python. It also offers an easy procedure for users to develop their own applications with mixed Python/C/C++/Fortran/CUDA programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve above goals, An AlTar/pyre application is constructed and runs slightly different from regular Python script applications. In this tutorial, we will use a `Hello world!` application to demonstrate the structure of an AlTar application."
